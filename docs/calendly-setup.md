This sounds like a larger project than our focused 60-minute sessions can address. AppSpark specializes in specific, tactical Cursor coaching.

If you need a scoped project bid or ongoing development work, please email us at info@appspark.ai with your requirements.

For focused Cursor challenges (scaffolding, specific blockers, deployment fixes, workflow optimization), please go back and select the coaching option.
